# MPRTU

Medical Physics Repository of Technical Understanding

I need a better name for this, any suggestions? The intent of this repository is to list code, resources, and tools commonly used in the medical physics community. Discussions will be allowed of course, and I might suggest that they take place elsewhyere. If you have found this page and believe that your tool would fit in this index please either submit a discussion, or use GitHub editing tools to create a PR.
